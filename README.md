# help-page-finder

This app allows to search for help articles on a website. It is using website's search engine instead of web scraping, because website's content is generated by javascript code after
initial loading (Vue.js). There is no reliable tool for web scraping with javascript execution for Android that I know of and web scraping is rather a backend task anyway. I tried
to make some of them work, but they are not working properly for this task, because of bugs or being out-of-date (ex. skrape{it}, HtmlUnit).
